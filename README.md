Installation
Steps:
1) Install Netbeans IDE if you do not have it: https://netbeans.org/community/releases/82/install.html
2) Create a new maven project > create a testNG or a jUnit class

Notes:
1) You will notice a few annotations i.e
@BeforeClass - methods under this annotation will be executed prior to each method in each test case.
@AfterClass - methods under this annotation will be executed after each method in each test case.
@Before - methods under this annotation will be executed prior to the first test case in the TestNG file.
@After - methods under this annotation will be executed after all test cases in the TestNG file are executed.
2) Pull the project to see what has been done on login, am hoping you learn something
